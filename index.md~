 The UAV searches and tracks the moving target (a vehicle) in an unknown area and send the position of the target to the UGV continuously.

 This project is designed to make it easy for users to operate multiple computers with a single mouse and keyboard. Face orientation recognition algorithm is used to find which computer the user desires to use. Then the device automatically switches the mouse & keyboard signals to that computer.

I designed a localization algorithm which can be used for docking with the auto-charge station. The algorithm uses 2D-laser SLAM and visual-based charge station detection to localize the robot. Up until now, the robot has been deployed into service at 35 banks for 2 years.
