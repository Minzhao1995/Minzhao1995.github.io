# About Me
&ensp;&ensp;My name is Minzhao Zhu.I am a engineer at Bytedance AI Lab. Before that, I received M.S degree of Control Science and Engineering in Beijing Institute of Technology. My research interests are localization and perception of robots. ([CV](https://minzhao1995.github.io/figures/MinzhaoZhu_BIT.pdf))

<center>Mapping Result</center>
 &ensp;&ensp;This is my undergraduate research. I designed a method for complementing the blind spot of the UGV. The LiDAR point cloud is divided into 720 sectors. The blind areas are detected in each sector. Then the UAV uses ORB-SLAM to construct the map of the blind areas. The AprilTags is used to calculate the transformation between the map constructed by the UAV and UGV.
	

# Projects
### UAV-UGV Cooperative System

&ensp;&ensp;The UAV and UGV searches and tracks the moving target (a vehicle) in an unknown area (3 km x 3 km) collaboratively. I led our team to build this system and we won the 2018 China Unmanned System Challenge (Air-Ground Collaboration Contest).

&ensp;&ensp;We won the First Prize in 2017 China Smart Car Future Challenge Highway Contest. As a team member, I designed a lane detection algorithm and a LiDAR-based accessible region detection algorithm.

### Intelligent Mouse and Keyboard Switcher

<center>Demonstration of Usage</center>

&ensp;&ensp;This project is designed to make it easy for users to operate multiple computers with a single mouse and keyboard. Face orientation recognition algorithm is used to find which computer the user desires to use. Then the device automatically switches the mouse & keyboard signals to that computer.

&ensp;&ensp;This mobile robot is designed for bank reception service. I designed a 2D-SLAM algorithm in which The weight of points with high roughness is enhanced so that scan matching in the longitudinal direction can be more accurate. Up until now, the robot has been deployed into service at 35 banks for 2 years.
