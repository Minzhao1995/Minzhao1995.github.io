&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Proposed a localization method that uses satellite image as the prior information to achieve localization in GNSS-denied area. A neural network is proposed to compare the LiDAR grid-map with the satellite image patch in the Bird&apos;s Eye View (BEV). The network first extracts the spatial-discriminative feature maps of the grid-map and the satellite image respectively, then a classification network is used to compare the feature maps and outputs the probability of correspondence. Then based on the outputs, a particle filter is used to obtain the probability distribution of the vehicle&apos;s pose.

&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;The UAV searches and tracks the moving target (a vehicle) in an unknown area and send the position of the target to the UGV continuously.
